## Independencies
The RPCS3.net [Compatibility List](https://github.com/AniLeo/rpcs3-compatibility "RPCS3 Compatibility List repository") by [AniLeo](https://github.com/AniLeo "AniLeo's GitHub Profile") allows users to sort listed games by status, first character, region, last update date or by typing the games ID or title in the searchbox as well as order listed games by ID, Title, commit, status or last update date both asynchronously and desynchronously. Users won't have to search exactly by a game's title to find it in the database.

The Levenshtein string comparisons ensures that the closest game is returned when no results are found and abbreviated search allows the user to search for games using abbreviations.

## Deployment
Simply download the repository files and upload them to your web server or open them in a text editor, preferably [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/). Based on the web server, RPCS3.net comes pre-defined as a SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) website. This may cause issues with web servers or web server emulators that do not have SSL capabilities. To fix this issue, .htaccess must be modified accordingly. For the [Compatibility List](https://github.com/AniLeo/rpcs3-compatibility "RPCS3 Compatibility List repository") portion of the website, simply place files inside the lib/compat directory inside the website's source code.
