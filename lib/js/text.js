The emulator has been in development since early 2011 and currently supports modern DirectX 12, Vulkan and OpenGL renderers. The emulator is capable of booting and playing a decent amount of commercial games and many more are becoming playable with future developments. The source code for RPCS3 is hosted publicly on our GitHub. You're welcome to grab the latest compiled revisions from our AppVeyor or compile your own build for personal use.");

The funding received from our patrons will go towards, but is not limited to: Support for core developers to spend full-time working on the emulator, obtaining hardware for development and testing, and maintaining the official RPCS3 website along with a compatibility database.");
