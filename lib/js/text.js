The emulator has been in development since early 2011 and currently supports modern Vulkan, DirectX 12 and OpenGL renderers. The emulator is capable of booting and playing a decent amount of commercial games and PlayStation 3 SDK samples. Many more titles are also becoming playable with future development by our contributors. The source code for RPCS3 is hosted publicly on our GitHub. You're welcome to grab the latest compiled revisions from our AppVeyor or compile your own build for personal use.");
