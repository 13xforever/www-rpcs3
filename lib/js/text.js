The emulator has been in development since early 2011 and currently supports modern DirectX 12, Vulkan and OpenGL renderers. The emulator is capable of booting and playing a decent amount of commercial games and PlayStation 3 SDK samples. Many more titles are also becoming playable with future development by our contributors. The source code for RPCS3 is hosted publicly on our GitHub. You're welcome to grab the latest compiled revisions from our AppVeyor or compile your own build for personal use.");

Find something you want to add, implement or improve on such as broken games, emulation bugs, missing features or the addition of roadmaps. Once you feel comfortable with your work, test your changes and send a pull request and we'll review it. Feel free to ask any RPCS3 developers on the RPCS3 GitHub or Discord server if you have questions or concerns.");

There are lot of implementations to be made and a lot of optimizations to be done. Working on an emulator in general is very exciting, but it's also extremely time-consuming. This is where you come in. The funding received from our patrons will go towards, but is not limited to: Support for core developers to spend full-time working on the emulator, obtaining hardware for development and testing, and maintaining the official RPCS3 website along with a compatibility database.");
