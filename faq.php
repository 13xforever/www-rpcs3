						<h2>What is RPCS3 and where can I get it?</h2>
					</div>
					<div id='featured-tx2-block'>
						<p>
							 RPCS3 is an open-source Sony PlayStation 3 emulator and debugger written in C++ for Windows and Linux. The emulator has been in development since early 2011 and currently supports modern DirectX 12, Vulkan and OpenGL renderers. The emulator is capable of booting and playing a decent amount of commercial games and many more are becoming playable with future developments. The source code for RPCS3 is hosted publicly on our GitHub. You're welcome to grab the latest compiled revisions from our AppVeyor or compile your own build for personal use.

						<h2>Who are the creators behind RPCS3?</h2>
					</div>
					<div id='featured-tx2-block'>
						<p>
							 RPCS3 began development in early 2011 by a small team of programmers. Our current core developer, <a class="txt-link" href="https://github.com/Nekotekina">Nekotekina</a>, is hard at work ensuring RPCS3 meets its roadmap goals and that its development is always progressing forward. Since then, RPCS3 has progressed into an open source community-based project. The full list of contributors can be found on our GitHub page.

						<h2>Is RPCS3 aiming for complete accuracy or game specific hacks?</h2>
					</div>
					<div id='featured-tx2-block'>
						<p>
							 Our goal is to create the most accurate PlayStation 3 emulator possible. Previous PlayStation emulators tend to rely on game specific hacks and plugins to some extent, which don't guarantee full compatibility with all other PlayStation games and software.
						</p>

						<h2>Is RPCS3 designed for single-core performance or multi-threaded performance?</h2>
					</div>
					<div id='featured-tx2-block'>
						<p>
							 RPCS3 is designed to make use of as many threads as possible. This means that processors such as Intel's 8 core, 16 thread 6900K or AMD's 8 core, 16 thread Ryzen R7 1700X will benefit greatly for emulating games at higher speeds. CPUs such as the Intel Core i7-7700K and the AMD FX 8320 will suffice but will not perform equally as well as a processor with more cores and threads.

						<h2>How stable is RPCS3 in its current state?</h2>
					</div>
					<div id='featured-tx2-block'>
						<p>
							 RPCS3 is stable enough to boot into games and play many of them with ease. Stability is more of a per-game factor that may change with new builds as new features get implemented. As emulators progress in accuracy, there may be some regressions that occur and stability is typically one of them. Rest assured, the developers are always hard at work when it comes to keeping RPCS3 as stable as possible for now and into the future.

						<h2>What input devices can I use with RPCS3?</h2>
					</div>
					<div id='featured-tx2-block'>
						<p>
							 We currently support Keyboard and Mouse inputs and native XInput and Multimedia Joystick inputs through software thanks to our core developers and contributors. We plan to add additional input methods in the future, but they're currently low priority for now. If you can convert the inputs of an non-XInput or non-Multimedia Joystick through additional driver software, you are free to use any type of controller you want. This includes the DualShock®3 and DualShock®4 controllers as well.

						<h2>What PlayStation 3 peripherals can I use with RPCS3?</h2>
					</div>
					<div id='featured-tx2-block'>
						<p>
							 We currently don't have support for additional PlayStation 3 peripherals such as the PlayStation 3 Move controller(s) or the PlayStation Eye Camera. We plan to add support for them in the future once development is farther along or if a contributor implements compatibility for said peripheral beforehand.

						<h2>Can I just insert a PlayStation 3 game disc and start playing games?</h2>
					</div>
					<div id='featured-tx2-block'>
						<p>
							 In its current state, RPCS3 does not support reading game data directly from PlayStation 3 format discs. PlayStation 3 discs are formatted in a very special way that can only be read with an actual PlayStation 3 system, or a compatible Blu-ray drive from select manufacturers. For more information on what Blu-ray drives are capable of reading games, please refer to the <a class="txt-link" href="/quickstart">Quickstart Guide</a>.

						<h2>Where do I get PlayStation 3 games and software?</h2>
					</div>
					<div id='featured-tx2-block'>
						<p>
							 Typically, you want to dump your own PlayStation 3 games and software from your own console. We believe that this is the most efficient and safest way to migrate your disc-based games and digital games from your console to your PC.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							 You can also dump games using select compatible Blu-ray drives. Not every Blu-ray drive will recognize PlayStation 3 games due to how data is formatted on the disc. For more information on what Blu-ray drives are capable of reading games, please refer to the <a class="txt-link" href="/quickstart">Quickstart Guide</a>.

						<h2>How do I dump PlayStation 3 games and software?</h2>
					</div>
					<div id='featured-tx2-block'>
						<p>
							 You will need two different tools for dumping PlayStation 3 game discs from a Blu-ray drive. For more information on how to get started dumping your own games, please refer to the <a class="txt-link" href="/quickstart">Quickstart Guide</a>.

						<h2>Can I play multiplayer games online with real consoles or other RPCS3 users?</h2>
					</div>
					<div id='featured-tx2-block'>
						<p>
							 Unfortunately, this is not something we're remotely close to implementing just yet in RPCS3's current stage of development. Multiplayer is something we're thinking about, but we may not focus on it until RPCS3 is as stable and as accurate as possible. Playing games online with real PlayStation 3 systems would require the client to connect to PlayStation Network which isn't very feasible at the moment due to obvious technical and legal limitations.

						<h2>Can I play local-multiplayer games with RPCS3?</h2>
					</div>
					<div id='featured-tx2-block'>
						<p>
							 We currently do not have support for multiple controllers in RPCS3 just yet, but we plan to in the future once we're farther in development. The foundation for multiple controllers is already there, but it just isn't priority for now. Similarly to how the a PlayStation 3 has support for up to 7 concurrent controllers, we plan to replicate that feature in its entirety.

						<h2>Can I at least import my save data from my real PlayStation 3? </h2>
					</div>
					<div id='featured-tx2-block'>
						<p>
							 Yes, saves can be imported from a real PlayStation 3 system using the standard USB flash drive transfer method. Due to how the user account system works on a real PlayStation 3 system, in some cases, you may need to re-sign your save. For more information on how to manage your save data within RPCS3, please refer to the <a class="txt-link" href="/quickstart">Quickstart Guide</a>.

						<h2>Will RPCS3 be ported to platform X or include feature Y?</h2>
					</div>
					<div id='featured-tx2-block'>
						<p>
							 As long as the platform is powerful enough to emulate the PlayStation 3, most likely yes. At the moment we only target Windows and Linux. macOS is not supported at the moment because it only supports up to OpenGL 4.1 and it currently doesn't support Vulkan or DirectX 12 either. The same applies to additional features. If they are reasonable and are requested by enough people, we will most likely agree and implement the feature. For now, we consider the emulator itself our biggest priority rather than all the other secondary features such as multiple languages, higher rendering resolutions, PlayStation Move support, etc.

						<h2>Where can I submit issues, feedback and comments that I want to report?</h2>
					</div>
					<div id='featured-tx2-block'>
						<p>
							 You can submit through the GitHub Issue Tracker (Development-related issues) or the through Forums (General questions, support and commercial / homebrew games discussion). Please be sure to follow the guidelines before sending anything:
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							 • Check if the issue is meaningful for the team (e.g. GTA V doesn't work is obvious and therefore useless).
						</p>
						<p>
							 • Search older issues/threads to see if your issue was already submitted.
						</p>
						<p>
							 • Please use an understandable English. It doesn't need to be perfect, but clear enough to understand your message.
						</p>
						<p>
							 • While reporting issues, don't forget to include details about your system (OS, CPU, GPU, etc.), as well as the RPCS3.log file.
						</p>
						<p>
							 • When reporting issues on the forum, be sure to read how to properly report.
